# Getting started

## Requirements

- Docker with Compose v2.
- A Telegram application API ID and hash from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
- For the Bash migration helper: Bash, curl and jq.

The application API ID/hash identify your Telegram application. They are different
from a bot token issued by BotFather.

## Prepare

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ichinya/tg-selfhost-botapi.git
cd tg-selfhost-botapi
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `API_ID` and `API_HASH` in `.env`. Keep that file private.

For the split file profile on Linux, prepare `./files` before startup:

```sh
sudo install -d -o 101 -g 101 -m 0770 ./files
```

The reader/handler profile additionally requires Linux/amd64, kernel >= 5.6 and
openat2. Use a qualified Bot API/downloads image pair. Prepare private token and
registry files outside media, then mount only the selected full-token bot-root
read-only at the same absolute path. See [the file contract](configuration.md#files-in-local-mode)
and the repository's `examples/files/README.md` for commands; source examples are
excluded from Pages. Base HTTP file downloads are unsupported; remote downloads
require the opt-in override and operator HTTPS ingress on the `18082` proxy.

The gateway binds to `127.0.0.1` by default and does not expose the state directory.
If remote clients, including a webhook receiver, must reach the Bot API, set
`GATEWAY_BIND=0.0.0.0` in `.env` and provide HTTPS and network access controls.

## Start

Before the first GHCR publication, build locally:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d --build
```

Once a published image is available:

```sh
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

For a private GHCR package, authenticate with an account that has package access;
for anonymous pulls, the repository owner must make the package public.
Local compilation can take a long time. The default build uses one compilation job.

## Verify

```sh
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=100 botapi gateway
curl --connect-timeout 5 --max-time 10 -i http://127.0.0.1:18080/
```

A response from the Bot API path confirms HTTP reachability, even if it reports a
missing method or token. It does not confirm a bot session or webhook delivery.

The application endpoint is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:18080/bot<TOKEN>/<METHOD>
```

Use token-bearing calls only on the chosen server at the appropriate migration
stage. To check a bot already assigned to this server:

```sh
read -rsp 'Bot token: ' BOT_TOKEN; printf '\n'
curl --connect-timeout 5 --max-time 15 \
  "http://127.0.0.1:18080/bot$BOT_TOKEN/getMe"
unset BOT_TOKEN
```

These command examples use Bash. A token expanded into curl's URL can be visible
in process arguments and access logs; run diagnostics in a trusted environment.
