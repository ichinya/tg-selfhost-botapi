# Maintenance

## Migration acceptance

Use the required Linux/Node 24 mock gate documented in CONTRIBUTING. It covers
response loss before/after effects, per-bot locking, crashes around intent and
receipt, interface plan parity, helper access and UI response loss. The volume
gate operates only on exact fixture IDs/labels and preserves production data.
CI checks that required files are tracked and that no private artifacts enter
the rendered site. Platform skips are not acceptance. The old curl-specific
request assertions are retained as reference; executable adapter tests now
exercise the same loopback protocol/journal as the canonical CLI. Issue #9's
missing delivery-action fixture is a separate declared workspace baseline.

Restarting the helper requires a new session code and private runtime inputs.
Keep the same journal/key. Browser disconnect does not cancel the background
job. Read status and its job result, then resupply credentials before resume.
An operation locator is not authorization.

## Recovering the migration journal

Back up the whole private authority **together with `binding.key`** while idle.
Restore both with their owner and private modes. Missing keys, token rotation,
corrupt or unsupported state block continuation. Interrupted durable intents
become UNKNOWN. Restore the original authority and reconcile the same operation;
starting an empty state root cannot establish whether a remote effect occurred.

After a UI timeout read the same operation's offline status first. If only the
browser lost the response, durable receipts still apply. If the Bot API response
was lost, reconcile UNKNOWN with a trusted provider receipt bound to the exact
operation/digest/attempt/endpoints/token and observation time. Without evidence,
keep it blocked. A changed token/deployment/profile requires investigation and
review, preserving the original journal; never erase confirmed history.

## Image pipeline

The image workflow checks official tdlib source and the Alpine 3.22 digest every
night around **04:37 Asia/Yekaterinburg** (23:37 UTC), on default-branch changes,
and on manual runs. GitHub may delay scheduled runs.

The build key covers the resolved revisions/digests and the recipe, entrypoint,
patch and image tests. If the corresponding published build exists, compilation
is skipped. If registry inspection cannot confirm it, the pipeline rebuilds.

For a new build it:

1. Checks that the User-Agent patch applies to the selected official revision.
2. Compiles the entire server.
3. Runs `--version`, checks the header string in the binary and validates entrypoint syntax.
4. Publishes `ghcr.io/ichinya/tg-selfhost-botapi:build-<key>` and promotes `latest`.

Failed checks leave the previously published `latest` in place. Pull requests do
not publish. A binary string check is not a live webhook-delivery test.

The workflow needs to be on the default branch before the schedule/publication
can work. GHCR writes use `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `packages: write`. Configure package
visibility or client authentication after the first publication.

## Update an installation

Registry publication does not restart your VPS. Select a tested tag/digest with
`BOTAPI_IMAGE` in `.env`, then:

```sh
docker compose stop botapi
# Make a consistent backup of ./data and private configuration here.
docker compose pull botapi
docker compose up -d --no-deps botapi
docker compose logs --tail=100 botapi
```

For a locally built installation, use the build override consistently:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml stop botapi
# Back up ./data and private configuration before replacing the binary.
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml build botapi
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d --no-deps botapi
```

Preserve `./data`, ownership `101:101`, the API endpoint and local-mode settings.
Do not run two Bot API processes against one data directory. Restoring an old
image may also require a compatible state backup; image rollback alone is not
a guarantee.

After an update, check service logs and send a test message to a bot already
assigned to the server. Confirm the actual webhook URL, delivery status and
User-Agent in the receiving service's logs.

## Diagnostics

```sh
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=100 botapi gateway
docker compose exec botapi telegram-bot-api --version
```

Remove tokens, API hashes, webhook secrets and sensitive URLs before sharing
logs. Separate infrastructure reachability from bot authorization and delivery.

## Documentation and contributions

Documentation lives in `docs/en` and `docs/ru`. Update both languages for
behavioral changes. The short root README links to these guides.

The Pages site uses Jekyll from the existing `main /` publishing source.
`_config.yml` supplies the project base path and navigation; `_layouts/default.html`
is the shared layout. Markdown links are rewritten for Pages by
`jekyll-relative-links`, while remaining usable on GitHub.

The original `tg_selfhost_botapi_migrator.html` URL remains available. Docs changes
are built in PRs without deployment; merging to `main` publishes through the
existing Pages integration.

### Doctor preflight

`python3 tools/doctor.py --scenario official-to-self --format json` provides a
versioned diagnostic report. Use Python 3.11 or newer. JSON and text share exit
codes: 0 READY, 1 BLOCKED, 2 invalid invocation/input, 3 UNKNOWN (including internal collection errors). READY covers
migration prerequisites, not authorization or delivery. Missing evidence remains
UNKNOWN. Subprocesses and token-free HTTP share a deadline (60 seconds by default,
5 seconds per operation). HTTP has no proxy, redirects or retries, verifies TLS,
and reads at most 16 KiB. Reports omit raw outputs and redact credential patterns.

Process evidence comes from `/proc` in the selected container, including effective
UID/GID/groups. Root probes require a 404 JSON response with `ok:false` and integer
`error_code:404`; a generic 404 is insufficient. Direct bridge probing is supported
on a local Linux engine. Docker Desktop, remote engines, external proxies and
ambiguous bindings leave the affected checks UNKNOWN. No bot or cloud method is
called. Actual image config IDs, registry digests and binary versions are separate
fields; a local image without registry digests is reported honestly without pull.
Stopped, paused, restarting, dead or unhealthy containers block readiness;
pending health remains UNKNOWN. An unavailable endpoint is BLOCKED at a supported
observation point; an unavailable observation point remains UNKNOWN.
Exposure findings use parsed nginx includes plus independent mount isolation.
A random 404 is not evidence of isolation. A state alias or accessible state mount
blocks readiness; the shipped proxy and logging map are supported. Doctor does not reload nginx.

### Doctor regression checks

Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tools -p 'test_doctor*.py' -v` and
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tools -p 'test_check_doctor.py' -v` for pure tests.
The explicit `python3 tools/check_doctor.py` command creates and removes only its
random synthetic Compose project. It checks real nginx, volumes, runtime UID,
root-only HTTP requests and probe cleanup. The harness may pull/build its test
images; doctor itself only inspects the selected installation. Base version tags
are resolved to immutable registry digests at harness start and recorded in its
result; approved digests can be supplied via `DOCTOR_PYTHON_IMAGE` and
`DOCTOR_NGINX_IMAGE`. Reports distinguish synthetic integration, real-image smoke,
CI and production. A skipped gate is NOTRUN, never PASS.
Pure regressions also cover self-to-self selected-subtree capacity, shared-state
rejection, compatibility uncertainty and credential sentinels in both renderers.
The doctor workflow runs the repository unit suite and fixture shell syntax check
before the separate synthetic Docker gate.

### Doctor operator reference

Select the same ordered Compose inputs used for deployment:

```sh
python3 tools/doctor.py -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml \
  --env-file /private/installation.env --project-directory /private/stack \
  -p installation --scenario official-to-self \
  --migration-input /private/decisions.json --format json
```

Profiles use repeatable `--profile`. For self-to-self add a separate ordered
`--source-file` list and the corresponding `--source-env-file`, `--source-profile`,
`--source-project-directory`, `--source-project-name`; use
`--source-gateway-url` only for a mapped source binding. The main context is the
target, except in self-to-official where it is the local source.

| Option / result | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--gateway-url` | Optional selected published endpoint; no credentials, query, fragment or bot path |
| `--timeout`, `--deadline` | Positive seconds; defaults 5 and 60 |
| `--no-write-probe` | No doctor writes; write evidence UNKNOWN |
| `--min-free-bytes`, `--min-free-inodes` | Positive integer reserve thresholds; defaults 1073741824 and 1024 |
| `--format text` / `json` | Same decision and exit; JSON is one stdout document |
| 0 / READY | All required preflight evidence passes |
| 1 / BLOCKED | At least one required condition fails |
| 3 / UNKNOWN | Required evidence is incomplete and no required condition fails |
| 2 / UNKNOWN | Invalid invocation or private input |

Report schema: `tools/doctor.schema.json`. Input schema:
`tools/doctor-input.schema.json`. Keep real inputs and reports private, outside
VCS, docs and the webroot. Do not paste tokens or API hashes into CLI arguments.
Wildcard published addresses become loopback; multiple bindings require an exact
explicit selection. Opaque reverse proxies and deployment prefixes currently
remain `endpoint_mapping_unverified`; they are not probed. No cloud HTTP request,
getMe, logOut, close, webhook change or migration is performed. Re-run diagnosis
when containers, mounts or configuration change; READY does not certify future
state, Telegram sessions or the Bash/browser executor.

JSON v1 uses `infrastructure`, `migration.executor_support`, and checks with `check_id` and `PASS|FAIL|UNKNOWN|SKIP`. Internal errors retain earlier findings; required FAIL takes precedence over UNKNOWN. Empty or skipped required evidence cannot establish readiness.

Exit 2 also covers an invalid Compose configuration or missing Compose JSON
capability. Missing Docker/daemon access yields UNKNOWN/3. Version, process,
configuration and storage execs have a container-side deadline as well as the
shared host budget. Unsupported timeout utilities leave evidence UNKNOWN.

Empty registry metadata uses `local_build` only for a selected Compose build;
otherwise it uses `registry_digest_unavailable`. No registry request is made.
`runtime_changed` invalidates dependent evidence when container identity, restart
count, effective Compose model or the on-disk nginx snapshot changes.
For `quota_accounting_unverified`, verify the service identity's actual quota
headroom separately. `unsafe_input_permissions` is BLOCKED/1; unreadable or
malformed private input is exit 2, and unverified platform privacy is UNKNOWN/3.

### Private migration evidence

The root helper keeps schema version 1 intent/receipt/summary evidence under
`logs/migration` beside the script, with directories 0700 and files 0600. Keep
this outside public hosting; the publication checker rejects `logs`. Retention
continues until deliberate manual deletion after reconciliation. Never attach
raw capture or the dossier to public issues. A crash can retain private raw;
normal capture removes it only after successful sanitization. The summary marks
possible retention when finalization fails.

An active/stale lock, unfinished intent, UNKNOWN authenticated attempt or partial
migration blocks the next run before HTTP. Stop and inspect independent evidence;
there is no automatic unlock, retry or resume. Schema v1 is an input contract for
an explicit future #2 adapter, not that issue's final durable journal. See
[outcomes and private diagnostics](migration.md#outcomes-and-private-diagnostics).

For manual recovery, stop every helper, reconcile all attempts with independent
evidence, and decide the safe next procedure. Archive the complete dossier in an
owner-only location outside `logs/migration` before removing reconciled run
directories and a stale lock. Keep the archive until resolution. A lock must
never be removed merely to retry an unknown request. An unfinished token-free
probe without a surviving lock does not block; authenticated unfinished attempts do.

## Isolated mock walkthrough

Use Linux/WSL and the following loopback-only fixture. It cannot send requests
to Telegram. Each scenario starts fresh fixture servers and private state; this
is not a recovery recipe for a real bot. Set `MIGRATION_FIXTURE_DIRECTION` to
one of the four direction names before starting. Complete within the evidence
TTL (five minutes), otherwise restart the fixture for a new isolated scenario.

```sh
umask 077
PYTHONPATH=tools python3 - <<'PY'
import json, os, tempfile
from pathlib import Path
from migration_mock import Bot, TOKEN, deployment
from migration_helper import Application, Server, write_bootstrap
root = Path(tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="botapi-fixture-"))
source, target = Bot("source"), Bot("target")
direction = os.environ.get("MIGRATION_FIXTURE_DIRECTION", "cloud_to_local")
endpoint = source.endpoint if direction == "webhook_only" else target.endpoint
evidence = root / "deployment.json"
record = deployment(endpoint)
record["local_mode"] = direction != "local_to_cloud"
evidence.write_text(json.dumps(record))
evidence.chmod(0o600)
app = Application({"state_dir": str(root / "state"), "allowed_endpoints": [source.endpoint, target.endpoint],
                   "evidence_file": str(evidence), "trust_file": None, "fixture": True})
server = Server(app, 8765)
pairing = root / "pairing-code"
write_bootstrap(pairing, server.bootstrap, [root / "state"])
print("Synthetic fixture only:", server.origin, "private pairing file:", pairing, flush=True)
print("Source:", source.endpoint, "Target:", endpoint, "Token:", TOKEN, "Direction:", direction, flush=True)
print("Retained fixture authority:", root, flush=True)
try:
    server.serve_forever()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass
finally:
    server.server_close(); app.close(); target.close(); source.close()
PY
```

1. Read the one-time code privately from the pairing file. Enter the printed fixture endpoints/
   synthetic token, matching direction/mode, explicit polling and quiescence JSON
   `"fixture"`. Local → Cloud also selects queue acknowledgement and cooldown 0.
2. Plan, review the digest, then Apply. Confirm source detach precedes target
   authorization. The migration remains partial until endpoint/start checkpoints.
3. Enter `"fixture"` for endpoint-change and application-start receipts, then
   Resume. Keep delivery as NOTRUN until a separate receiver receipt is imported.
4. For Local → Local, execution first blocks after close. A fixture transfer
   receipt needs exact operation_id/digest/close_attempt/source_fingerprint/
   target_fingerprint, target_deployment equal to the plan deployment fingerprint,
   matching 64-hex source_manifest/target_manifest, a 64-hex source_deployment,
   uid/gid 1000, current observed_at and true source_closed/no_writers/layout_valid.
   This tests the attestation boundary, not a real TDLib directory transfer.
5. Reload the browser and read status. Repeated Resume does not increase confirmed
   mutation counters. Automated fault tests separately inject lost responses.

Provision real providers in a private `MIGRATION_TRUST_FILE` with shape
`{"providers":{"audit":{"key_hex":"<private-64-hex-key>","kinds":["quiescence","effect","endpoint_change","application_start","state_transfer","delivery"],"fixture":false}}}`.
A signed envelope has provider/payload/signature. Signature is HMAC-SHA256 of
canonical sorted compact ASCII JSON payload using that independent key. Common
payload fields: version 1, kind, operation_id, digest, source_fingerprint,
target_fingerprint, token_fingerprint and observed_at. Quiescence additionally
requires no_writers=true; endpoint/start require endpoint_fingerprint. Provider
implementations must verify the external facts before signing. No provider is
trusted by default, and fixture providers cannot attest real operations.
